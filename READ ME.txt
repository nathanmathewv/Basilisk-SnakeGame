in order to run this program a few presets is required

first step is to copy the entire folder named "final" into your computer

modules to be installed in python
 - mysql-connector-python
 - pygame
 - pyglet

mysql needs to be setup in order for the program to work
 - a database named snake_game needs to be made
 - it needs a table called scores
 - it needs the following structure
  	-name   char(100)
	-score	integer
	-speed	char(50)
	-size	char(50)
 - the default password used is "password"
 - if the password is differnet for your mysql then it is required for you to change it in line no 29
 - it is a requirement that the table needs to have 5 items in it in order for the program to work
 - it is recommended that the following syntax be used for setting the initial 5 items 
 - <name> , 0, "slow", "small"
 - these names need to be added manually within the mysql table
 - basic knowledge of creating and inserting values in mysql is required in order to run this program

after doing all this initial setup all you need to do is to run the program called "program.py"
